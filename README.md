# AI-Based Rule-Based Student Assistance Chatbot
This project is developed as part of the AI and Expert System Design Lab.

The chatbot is a Python terminal-based application that assists students by answering common academic and AI-related questions using rule-based expert system logic and basic natural language processing techniques.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate knowledge representation, inference rules, and intelligent decision-making without using paid APIs or machine learning models.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Rule-based logic
- Basic NLP (keyword matching)

## Project Status
Initial setup. Features and implementation will be added incrementally.

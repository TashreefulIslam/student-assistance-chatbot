## 📌 Project Proposal

---

## 1. Introduction

With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, intelligent systems can assist students by providing instant academic guidance and support. Students often face difficulties in understanding subjects, planning studies, and getting timely help. Human assistance is not always available, especially outside class hours.

This project proposes a **Student Assistant Chatbot**, a **domain-based AI system** designed to help students by answering academic-related queries through natural language interaction. The chatbot will use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **expert system concepts** to provide intelligent, rule-based responses. The system will be developed using **Python** and **free/open-source APIs and libraries**, making it suitable for educational use.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Students frequently need help with:
- Understanding academic concepts
- Choosing or managing subjects
- Planning study schedules
- Preparing for exams

Providing manual support for every student query is time-consuming and inefficient. There is a need for an automated, intelligent system that can assist students by understanding their questions and providing relevant guidance within the academic domain.

## 3. Objectives of the Project

The main objectives of this project are:

- To develop a **domain-based AI chatbot** for student assistance  
- To apply **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for understanding user input  
- To implement a **rule-based expert system** for decision making  
- To provide academic guidance, study tips, and subject-related information  
- To use only **free APIs and open-source tools**  
- To build a simple and beginner-friendly AI system for educational purposes  

---

## 4. Scope of the Project

### Included:
- Academic and student-related queries
- Study guidance and preparation tips
- Subject-related explanations
- Rule-based responses within a predefined domain
- Terminal-based chatbot interaction

### Excluded:
- Paid APIs or services
- Voice-based interaction
- Real-time university database integration
- Commercial deployment

## 5. System Description

The **Student Assistant Chatbot** will operate as follows:

1. The user inputs a question in natural language  
2. The system preprocesses the input using NLP techniques  
3. Keywords and user intent are identified  
4. A rule-based inference engine applies predefined rules  
5. The chatbot generates a relevant academic response  

This system is **domain-specific**, meaning it focuses only on student and academic assistance.
